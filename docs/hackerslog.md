# Hacker's Log

20251010 - This hackathon starts on the day of our anniversary!! We wanted to design a game for fun on our anniversary so we thought, why not sign up to the hackathon and share there what we built! Maybe hit some bounties as a bonus! Brainstormed many ideas and settled on this one that we both find fun.

20251011 - Didn't do much beside keep on chatting about the idea and designing the game mechanics.

20251013 - Initialized a project and checked out hardhat3. Implemented game contracts.

20251014 - Finished one extremely simple version of the game. It's not very fun though. Decided we should spend some time designing the game as if we were players.

20251023 - Finalized the game design! Finally! Saved the last week for implementation. Perfect!

20251024 - Implemented contract logic and backend server for AI logic.

20251025 - Found out that the project was due tomorrow and not Oct 31st! Whaaaat?! Ok, prepare a submission first and tweak later if we have time tomorrow... D:
