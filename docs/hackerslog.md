# Hacker's Log

20251010 - This hackathon starts on the day of our anniversary!! We wanted to design a game for fun on our anniversary so we thought, why not sign up to the hackathon and share there what we built! Maybe hit some bounties as a bonus! Brainstormed many ideas and settled on this one that we both find fun.

20251011 - Didn't do much beside keep on chatting about the idea and designing the game mechanics.

20251013 - Initialized a project and checked out hardhat3. Implemented game contracts.
